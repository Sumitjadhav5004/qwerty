#In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students play 
#badminton and group C students play football. 
#3Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
#a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
#b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
#(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in 
#functions
